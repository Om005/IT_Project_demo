1. Interviews
We will conduct face-to-face or virtual interviews with different students and will prepare both open-ended and closed-ended questions to explore their needs and challenges.
Reason of Choice: Interviews help in collecting in-depth, qualitative information. They give insights into user expectations, learning difficulties, and desired features and also help in getting instant feedback from learners.


2. Questionnaires / Surveys
We will distribute structured online surveys to a large pool of potential users. The survey will include multiple-choice questions, rating scales, and open-ended sections to get insights of required features.
Reason of Choice: Surveys are effective for collecting data from a large audience quickly. They help identify patterns and common requirements among learners and instructors. This technique is cost-effective, scalable, and useful to validate which features are most demanded.


3. Brainstorming Sessions
We will organize collaborative sessions where learners can share and discuss ideas freely, e.g., features like roadmap generation, progress tracking, IDE, course management etc.
Reason of Choice: Brainstorming is useful for generating creative and innovative ideas that might not come up in structured interviews. It encourages active participation and helps in thinking beyond conventional solutions


4. Observation
We will observe how students currently learn via existing coding platforms.  We will take notes of where they struggle, such as difficulty in getting proper structured resources for specific topics etc.
Reason Of Choice: Observation provides real behavioral insights that users might not articulate during interviews or surveys. It helps in identifying usability issues and hidden requirements, leading to a more user-friendly learning experience.


5. Prototyping
We will build wireframes, mockups, or low-fidelity prototypes of the platformâ€™s interface (e.g., dashboards, coding environment, progress trackers etc) and share them with students and instructors for early feedback.
Reason Of Choice: Prototyping allows stakeholders to visualize the system before it is fully developed. Users can point out missing features, confusing layouts, or improvements, which helps refine requirements early on.
